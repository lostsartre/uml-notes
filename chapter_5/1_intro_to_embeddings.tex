\section{Overview and Motivation}
Not all data people deal with has a ``vector space"
representation. For example, we might only have a similarity matrix,
like the following: 
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    & $x_1$ & $x_2$ & $x_3$ & $x_4$\\
    \hline
    $x_1$ & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline
    $x_2$ & 1 & 0 & 2 & 2 \\ \hline
    $x_3$ & 1 & 2 & 0 & 2 \\ \hline
    $x_4$ & 1 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\ \hline
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Typical goals}:
\begin{itemize}
\item gain better understanding of the relationship among data points.
\item embed the data into a space (typically $\mathbb{R}^d,l_2$) that
  we understand better. We can then apply off-the-shelf
  models/algorithms etc. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dimensionality Reduction}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduce ``noise'' (noise is application-specific; whatever you do
  not care about.) 
\item Increase computational efficiency.
\item Save more space.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Metric Embedding}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Given a metric space $(X,\rho)$, want to "embed" it into a
  "normed" space $\underbrace{(R^d,l_p)}_{l^d_p}$. 
\item Computational efficiency.
\end{itemize}

The goal for an \emph{embedding} is a function
$f:\mathbf{X}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$, where $\forall u,v \in
\mathbf{X}$, $||f(u)-f(v)||_{l_p^d} \approx \rho(u,v)$. And it's especially great if $\forall \mathbf{(X,\rho)}, \exists f:\mathbf{X}\rightarrow R^d, s.t. \forall x, x' \in \mathbf{X}, \rho(x,x')=||f(x)-f(x')||_{l_2^d}$, since we are familiar with the Euclidean space. However,
The bad news is: in general, there are finite metric spaces
$(\mathbf{X},p)$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $n$-point metric space, that
cannot be isometrically embedded into $l_2^d$ for any $d$ (in other
word, no embeddings preserve distance exactly). See the following
figure for an example. \\

\begin{proof}
We prove it by contradiction. Assume we can embed $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ into a Euclidean space. According to the triangle inequality,  $x_1 ,x_2, x_3$, $x_1, x_2, x_3$, $x_1, x_3, x_4$ are all collinear. Thus, $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ are collinear with each other. However, no matter how we arrange the 4 points in a line, we cannot make the distance between one point and other three points equal. Thus there is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
Given two metric space $(X,\rho), (Y,\sigma)$. A mapping $f:
X\rightarrow Y$ is called a \emph{$D$-embedding} of $X$ into $Y$
(where $D\geq 1$) if there exists some $r>0$ such that $\forall x,x'
\in X$, 
\[
r \cdot \rho(x,x') \leq \sigma(f(x),f(x')) \leq D \cdot r \cdot
\rho(x,x') 
\]
\end{definition}
